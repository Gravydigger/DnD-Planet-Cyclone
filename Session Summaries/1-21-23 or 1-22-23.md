- [[Ashro]] receives a letter
	- It is from his father (Both a baron and a count)
	- The tone is relaxed but still formal
	- Most of it is small talk-esque, giving lots of bits of lore about [[Ashro]] and his family
	- At the end, his father asks [[Ashro]] to write him back, and that he can use the included wax to magically send the letter
	- Also included in the envelope: a chunk of magical wax, a pouch of lavender
- [[Ashro]] replies, then uses a portion of the wax + the mark from his signet ring (he has one of those), which causes the letter to animate and fly out the window
- [[Sylvia]], [[Tiz]], and [[Ashro]] spend a week getting information on [[Morningroughness]]
	- [[Sylvia]] and [[Tiz]] research (for the lols, yet still got good info)
	- [[Ashro]] gets info from the middle class of one of the towns near [[Morningroughness]] (carousing)
	- Info Gathered:
		- The early 140s saw the creation of the necromancy group Heroes of Bridging, founded by [[Olo Glacialglimmer]]
			- Mainly dwarves, a few humans
		- In the early winter of 144, the Heroes of Bridging founded [[Morningroughness]]
			- Civilized population: 10
			- Doesn’t require those living there to be necromancers
		- Have been known to attack nearby governments, mainly dwarven ones
			- All one-off attacks
			- Last attack was ~5 years ago
		- Seem relatively peaceful with nearby towns
		- Don’t like dwarves (I think?)
		- Neutral towards visitors, so there is a chance to interact with them in a non-hostile manner
- [[Ashro]] receives another letter from his father a few days after he sent his reply
	- More small talk-esque, but his father also asks him to come down and visit again sometime soon, and also extends that invitation to the rest of the group
		- He just asks that [[Ashro]] sends a letter first to inform his father that he is coming
- Later, [[Sylvia]], [[Ashro]], and [[Tiz]] talk about “Fred” in the war room
	- Fill [[Tiz]] in on what happened at the camp
	- They discuss following him, but decide against it for the time being
- They then go to see if anyone at the keep has noticed anything strange about “Fred”
	- They talk to the keep’s butler/head of staff, John Davis
- When asked, John reports:
	- The staff have seen him going out nightly, leaving just after dusk and returning an hour or two before dawn
	- He is relatively active in the mornings, but stays in his room the rest of the day
	- When asked if he needs anything from the servants, he always declines so they’ve stopped asking
	- “Fred” has asked for his room not to be cleaned by the staff
- John also asks if the three are ok with servants cleaning their rooms when they are out, all three say yes
- The three then go and knock on “Fred”’s door, and it is quite for a moment before he answers
	- They ask if he has discovered anything interesting, he says no due to not having enough data
	- They also ask if he has been getting enough sleep, he says yes due to sometimes sleeping out in the woods
	- Learn that “Fred” has added his own magical lock to the door
- The three leave “Fred” alone and decide that they are going to break into his room that night after he leaves
	- “Fred”’s room is on the outside wall and has a window, which has a latch but not a complicated one
- That night, the three grab a ladder from one the areas of the keep that under construction and put it under “Fred”’s window
- [[Sylvia]] uses detect magic and sees quite a bit of magic in “Fred”’s room
	- Sees:
		- The arcane lock on the door
		- Some divination
		- Abduration on the door, behind the door, and on the window
		- Faint temporal everywhere
- [[Sylvia]] dispels the alarm spell on the window and the three head in
- Essentially everything in “Fred”’s room:
	- A bed, covered in a layer of dust
	- A set of footprints (normal) indented into the carpet on the floor
	- A desk and chair, both not covered in dust
	- On the desk are:
		- A scrying pool (not dusty, also source of the divination magic)
		- A quill (dusty)
		- An inkwell with dried ink inside (due to unuse)
		- A stand for a book (not dusty)
- [[Ashro]] checks the scrying pool and sees that is used for detecting the locations of temporal disturbances/rifts within a large area
- The three decide they have seen what they need too and leave, resetting things back to where they were the best that they can
- They put back the ladder and then go to sleep

- ~7 months into the building of our castle, we hear rumors of a wizard looking for help with a “dungeon of time”
- He is also trying to make a new school of magic: chronomancy
- Group(plus Jaonos) went to meet this wizard, who’s name is Fredrick
- Frederick rambled about the dungeon for a bit, then lead us to where its entrance would be
- Opened the door and we all went through
- The group minus Trik and Jaonos explored the dungeon
- Rooms found:
	- A room covered in grass/plants that were growing out of humanoid remains, also had black goo
	- Room with broken walls revealing a system of rusted gears in a black void
	- Room with a bunch of objects frozen in time
	- Room with stone humanoid statues half in the walls and some creepy voices
	- Room with alchemy tools and weird spikes on the ceiling
- In the room with metal young dragon & flesh monster, Dice tried to grab a key from the dragon’s mouth and things went south
- Battle ensued
- Late into the battle, Trik was able to get into the room and help the group while using the objectively best spell, pass without a trace
- The dragon and flesh monster were defeated and we got the key they were guarding plus some more health potions

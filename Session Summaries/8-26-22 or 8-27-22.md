- Spent a large part of the session throwing around plans for the castle
- There will be a time skip of 400 days so the castle can be finished
- Downtime stuff can be done during this time, so some people worked out what downtime stuff they did during that time
- It was decided that we would leave chances every month for character interactions to happen
- Only one such character interaction was actually done in this session, which was what happens between [[Sylvia]]{Princess} and [[Ashro]]{Mont} after they finish decoding the note. The remainder of the session summary is devoted to that character interaction
- *Note: It is recommended you read the decoded note in “Codes & Ciphers” to understand the context of this part*
- Separately, both [[Ashro]] and [[Sylvia]] decode the note
	- Setting: private rooms of a tavern
- Due to the contents of the note, [[Sylvia]] leaves her copy of the note in her room and leaves her key with [[Ashro]], then goes to the temple to pray
- The rest of the group goes to the Baron([[Minkot]]) to share their findings
- Ash gives a short summary of the note but leaves out all information about [[Sylvia]]
- Ash gives a short summary(does not include info from the second paragraph)
	- An important NPC brought up is the Master(leader) of a goblin civilization, [[Em Crewmaligned]]. Info on her is in the NPC section.
- The Baron requests to see the encoded note, [[Ashro]] lies and says he doesn’t have the note on him, but the Baron doesn’t buy it
- [[Ashro]] ends up handing over the encoded note
- The Baron orders [[Ashro]] to bring him the decoded note(from where it was left in the tavern) and has [[Jaonos]] accompany [[Ashro]] so he doesn’t waste time
- [[Ashro]] and [[Jaonos]] go back to the tavern and chat some([[Jaonos]] didn’t know [[Ashro]] was lying about not having the og note but did find the exchange fishy)
- They get to the tavern and get both copies
- [[Jaonos]] reads [[Sylvia]]’s copy of the note and understands why [[Ashro]] was trying to avoid giving the Baron a copy of the note
- [[Jaonos]] takes [[Sylvia]]’s copy of the note and hides it in his boot, then he and [[Ashro]] try and figure out how to hide the mentions of [[Sylvia]] in the note
- They decide to erase her name and replace it with random letters and pretend it was just a mistake/issue decoding(something that happens easily with this type of cipher)
- [[Ashro]] changes the name and goes back to the Baron to drop off the note while [[Jaonos]] goes to the temple to try and check on [[Sylvia]]
- [[Sylvia]] is not at the temple, so [[Jaonos]] ask around if anyone has seen her
- [[Jaonos]] learns that she came to the temple, prayed for a short while, then left
- [[Jaonos]] asks some animals for help and learns that [[Sylvia]] left town to go to [[Sweepstrangers]]
- The change to the note works, and [[Ashro]] joins [[Jaonos]] in looking for [[Sylvia]]
- They get to [[Sweepstrangers]] and find [[Sylvia]] hiding in a snow drift
- [[Sylvia]] is scared but she and [[Ashro]] talk, and she eventually comes out of hiding
	- A previous encounter between [[Sylvia]] and someone discovering she was a goblin is referenced by [[Sylvia]], who shares that it ended with her being chased out of a town
- [[Ashro]] gives [[Sylvia]] a hug(the first one she has received in over 7 years)
- The three then return to town

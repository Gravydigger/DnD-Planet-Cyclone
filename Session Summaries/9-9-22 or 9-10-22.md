- Ashro, Venti, and Sylvia dragged the copper dragon to the exit portal, where it disappeared
- Jaonos and Trik are no longer in the portal room
	- Trik is still using pass without trace so can’t be seen
- The green door is opened with the green key
	- Leads to a hallway with two exits
- The group enters one of the doors and finds the armory
	- Filled with lots of rusted weapons and one rust-free axe(from now on referred to as the Raxe)
	- The closer a weapon is to the Raxe, the rustier it is
- Tiz picks up the Raxe, and after experimenting with it for a bit, puts it up against the exit door to force the lock and hinges to rust(from now on referred to as Raxe-ing)
- The group enters the ghost room
	- This room has a handful of translucent humanoid figures walking through it
- Venti tries touching a ghost and feels a bit sick(rolled well so the effects were minor)
- The group moves to the next room: the statue room
	- Has a number of statues, a mix of humanoid and monster
	- The door to the next room is locked
- Ashro investigates one of the statues and finds a hollow-sounding part
	- He uses a hammer to break it open and finds nothing
- Tiz Raxe-s the door
- Three of the statues in the room, which are actually gargoyles, apparently dislike Tiz’s sick hacks and attack
- At this point, Trik drops pass without trace and visibly joins the fight
- Everyone rolls pretty bad, so combat lasts a while
- The Raxe finishes its work and the door is opened
- Trik enters the next room(the button room) while combat continues
	- The room has 5 buttons, which Trik presses
	- The door to the next room(the tile room) opens
	- (Gonna be honest, idk how exactly the door got opened)
- After being heavily damaged, one gargoyle makes a hole in the wall and disappears down a hallway for a bit, then returns followed by a few swarms of bats
- The gargoyles and bats are eventually defeated
(Note: from here, Syl’s interactions are extremely limited as I was focused on taking notes)
- Trik casts pass without trace again, then goes ahead to the tile room before the rest of the group
	- The room has a tile floor, some of the tiles are tan and others are white
	- The tan tiles are safe, and the white tiles push you and deal force damage
- The rest of group investigates the hole where the bats came from
	- They find a room with bat nests and a see through wall that looks out at the portal room
	- They also find 35 gp and a potion(determined to be a drinkable potion that provides some buff, looks like iron)
- Trik goes through one of two exits of tile room, which leads to the spike pit hallway
	- The hallway has falling floor tiles that lead to a spike pit
	- Trik almost falls but manages to catch himself and get through the hallway
- The rest of group gets to the tile room and investigates
- Trik enters the next room(the statuette room)
	- The room has a black statuette on a pedestal in the middle of the room
	- Hanging above the statuette is a dark blue key
- Trik does the smart thing and only takes the key, leading to absolutely nothing happening
- Venti and Tiz get to the other exit of the tile room and observe the next room(the crusher room)
	- The room has crushed bodies on the floor and intestines squashed on the ceiling
- As Trik goes through the spike hallway again, he falls and nicks his foot on a spike but gets back up
- Tiz wants to go right into the crusher room, Venti tries to stop him but fails
- Ashro joins Venti at the door to the crusher room, and is stopped by Venti and also common sense
- Tiz catches his foot on the tripwire and the ceiling starts creaking, but Tiz doesn't notice (best time for a nat 1 in perception)
	- Venti sure notices and yells at Tiz to come back but he doesn't hear her
- Tiz makes it to the dark blue door but doesn’t have the key, so Raxe-s the door
- The ceiling smashes down and Tiz becomes a pancake
- The trap resets, and Venti & Trik venture carefully into the room
- Venti returns after peeking into 2nd part of room
- Trik notices a thin magic silver line at the opening between the two parts of the room
- Trik then comes back to rest of group and stops being a shadow to inform the group of the tripwire discovery
- There is deliberation on what to do
- To test the tripwire, Trik makes an illusion clone of himself who he sends to trigger the trapwire(after he gets out of the room)
- Illusion Trik triggers the trap
- After more debating, Ashro decides he’s just gonna go for it and takes the dark blue key from Trik
- Ashro successfully makes it to the dark blue door without triggering the trap
	- Sees the remains of Tiz’s body, which is completely destroyed minus the Raxe, which has partially Raxe-d the door
- Ashro opens the dark blue door and enters the gear room
	- The room has the temporal gear floating above a pedestal in the center of the room
		- The gear floats just above a metal spike(like magnets make things hover above them)
		- The gear rotates clockwise for a bit, then quickly turns back counter clockwise and emits a pulse of energy
	- The room is pristine, has no decay
	- There is also a switch near the door, which Ashro flips
- Metal beams rise out of the floor and up to the ceiling in the crusher room, disable the crusher
- The remaining group joins Ashro in the gear room
	- Trik picks up the Raxe
- It’s decided that just in case the dungeon starts to collapse after the gear is taken, they won’t take the gear yet so they can make sure they investigate the entire dungeon(one of the doors in the hallway after the green door wasn’t explored) and find Jaonos before they leave

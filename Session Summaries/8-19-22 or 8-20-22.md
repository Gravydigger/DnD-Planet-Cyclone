- The group met up in a tavern
- [[Tiz]]{Xeek} and [[Sylvia]](who is most definitely human){Princess} are introduced
- The group brought to the Baron([[Minkot]])
- [[Minkot]] asked the group to find out why the town’s food shipments hadn’t arrived, offered payment of 100k gp or something equivalent
- Group agreed to the quest, plans to leave the next day
- [[Minkot]] has an advisor accompany the group
- His name is [[Jaonos]](and is a character from a previous campaign)
- The group sleeps then meets back up in the morning and heads towards a nearby fortress(Lashbend)
- On the way, they came across the remnants of a skirmish between a merchant caravan and an unknown group of attackers
- A particular merchant’s body caught the group’s eye, and they found a note on his body([[may]] be relevant, [[may]] just be fun details)
- There were wagon tracks leading away from the scene, so the group followed them
- The tracks lead to some ruins([[Sweepstrangers]]), which was populated by a small group of goblins and two beakdogs
- The group decides they want to try and talk to the goblins before attacking
- A group of [[Tiz]], [[Sylvia]](who is still very much a human), and [[Ashro]]{Mont} go to try talking to the goblins, the rest of the group spreads out around the fortress
- [[Tiz]] talks to a goblin on a tower, the conversation doesn't get far and another goblin([[Nako]]) comes out
- [[Sylvia]] is angered by seeing [[Nako]] and shoots some magic at him, beginning combat
- Many goblins are killed, as is a beakdog
- [[Trik]] hides for all of the combat
- [[Nako]] eventually escapes on a beakdog
- Combat concludes
- The food shipments are found in the main part of the ruins
- [[Sylvia]] is prodded slightly for some backstory, and she runs from the conversation
- The group rests
- [[Sylvia]] and [[Flendar]]{Nips} find a note written by [[Nako]], but it is magically encoded
- [[Sylvia]] uses detect magic on the note and finds that the magic used on it is illusion magic
- She also sees that both [[Ashro]] and [[Jaonos]] have magic items, but does not comment
- [[Jaonos]] takes the letter back to town (Nourishedvises) to inform the Baron of the food and also the note
- A few hours later, a group of guards comes to bring the food back
- The group goes back to town and talk to the Baron
- We each get 100 gp, and the Baron says instead of the 100k gp(as the town physically doesn't have that money), we will get the land around the ruins and he will finance the building of whatever building we want there, and also assist with maintaining the building and paying people to help run the building(for a few months)

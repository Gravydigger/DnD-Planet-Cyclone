- In one of the rooms, the body of a disemboweled goblin is found
	- The goblin is holding a flute which Flendar recognizes as belonging to someone named Larry
	- Flendar takes the flute and whispers to it in a certain way, which causes it to glow

- The group uses pass without trace to pass by the nest and get to a room
- In said room is: a bag of holding, a bag of devouring, and a pomen(poem/omen)

- Tiz wants to put the bags together, everyone with a knowledge about these kinds of bags tries to explain to him why it’s a bad idea and then try to stop him(Sylvia has to tackle him)
- Sylvia, Ashro, and Venti all inspect the pomen
	- It is written on parchment, likely a prophecy written long ago

- Trik gets the lance and is able to get to safety, but the rest of the group doesn’t know this since they cant see him
- Dwane kills a harpy, which spooks the group(they think that it might be Trik)
	- All but Jeremiah are able to recognize that Trik wasn’t the being that was attacked
	- Jeremiah starts to run out of the room, but is stopped

- The group debates going to explore the area with the basilisks, but eventually they decide to just leave
- The giant pile of coins is gathered up into the bag of holding
- The group makes it out of the dungeon and into the tunnel system
- It is discovered that the bag of holding had an airtight box inside of it

	- Surprise! It’s poison!
	- Tiz and Flendar both take a lot of damage, and Flendar goes down but is quickly healed
	- The box is resealed and cleaned off
- The group continues through the tunnels and finds an alcove a bit before the tunnel forks, and they decide to set up camp and rest
- Everyone sleeps
- In the morning, the group continues towards Foundwheels
- Sylvia is concerned about the pomen, so Venti does a tarot card reading and determines that the pomen does seem to be a legit prophecy of some kind
	- (aka Fluffy did a real ass tarot card reading live with his tarot cards and it was super cool)
	- Sylvia continues to be concerned about the pomen
- The group arrives in Foundwheels and exchanges the large number of copper and silver pieces they got for gold pieces

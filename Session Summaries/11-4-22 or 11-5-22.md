## Main Session Summary
- BH has finished regenerating
- Trik’s message has been delivered to his clan
- Venti is very on edge, repeatedly looking out the windows
	- The sky is partly cloudy
	- The next day is a full moon
	- (Hmmm sus)
- Everyone sleeps
- Venti, Sylvia, and Flendar head out to see Fredrick
	- Tiz is doing things, Ashro is awkwardly helping Tiz, Trik is off talking to his tribe
- As the three arrive, they see “Fred”, who is very alive and has his head, working at his table
	- He turns around immediately & greets the group (which is pretty sus tbh)
- “Fred” says there has been a lot of temporal activity lately, then asks why the three are here
- Sylvia says that the group has run across stuff that falls in his area of expertise
	- “Fred” grabs a quill and paper and gets ready for notes (ah, a man after my own heart)
- They give explanations on most of the time-space things(I’m just making lists of the info learned, not necessarily how the conversation went exactly)
~Start: just info dump bullet points~
- Jaonoses
	- (Note: Jaonos’ name was never used)
	- The mess that’s going on with the Jaonoses is likely a Temporal Breakdown (a very bad thing), but is fixable
	- Something has caused timelines/universes to merge
	- To fix things, only one version of Jaonos can remain
	- Either the Jaonoses need to merge (by being in close proximity) or all but one needs to be killed
	- The person who is fractured has murky memories due to the memories being scattered across the versions
	- When one version dies, their memories are split among all the other versions (and maybe also when two or more merge, not 100% sure)
	- The less Jaonoses, the better and more complete their memories
- The Bellhop
	- Actual name: The Corrector
		- There seem to be many of them, possibly only one in this universe at the moment
	- Job: Fix problems with temporal stuff, the “first responder”, the “ambassador”
		- Is in favor of the affected universe (other temporal beings likely aren’t)
	- Uses the most direct route/option to fix things, but will use other methods if most direct isn’t working
		- Exactly what it deems as most direct/best for the universe changes from BH to BH
		- Can be reasoned with if they want to be reasoned with
	- Will go away when it deems the issue no longer exists
		- Once it is done, it will erase knowledge of its existence through magic (or murder)
		- Tends towards non-violent clean ups, but will take the easiest route
	- If it can’t fix things, it will lead to the “restart” aka eradication of the problem universe(s)/timeline(s)
	- A handful of infected people might not be see as reason to escalate things, but if BH is being blocked from them, that could result in escalation (yikes)
- Misc.
	- Clockwork Infection confirmed to be a marker
	- The Shadome was a weird “magic collision”
~End: just info dump bullet points~
- Sylvia brings up the three infected PPCs, “Fred” wants to go and see them as long as his stuff is protected
	- “Fred” says he might decide to stay at Sweepstrangers, but wants to see the PPCs first
- Sylvia stays, Flendar, Venti, and “Fred” head back to the castle
~Sylvia Cam~
- After about an hour of guarding, Sylvia gets a bit nosey
- She notices:
	- The Temporal Gear is no longer visible
	- A shovel with mud on it that was somewhat recently used
	- A vaguely human sized patch of ground near a tree that has been disturbed
	- A number of other patches of disturbed ground, all bucket-ish sized
	- An enchanted pen (by using detect magic)
~Venti & Flendar Cam~
- “Fred” enters the castle and complements it
- Venti leads “Fred” to the PPCs
- “Fred” begins looking at and testing the ooze from the Clockwork Infection
- “Fred” says he’ll be a while, but will let the group know if he needs anything
- Venti & Flendar leave him be
- About an hour later, Venti brings him tea & snacks
- Venti sees that one of the PPC’s ooze is now silvery-blue instead of black
- “Fred” says that it is due to him trying to find a way to see if he can mask the marker
- Venti leaves “Fred” to his work
~Sylvia Cam~
- Sylvia is no longer being nosey and is just kinda chilling & keeping watch
- She sees a couple of travelers on the road north of the camp
	- They wave, she waves back
- She sees a figure on a horse, shrouded in black burka-like clothing who begins to approach
	- The clothing is actually also medium/heavy armor
		- It has an insignia
	- The face is covered by a mesh-like covering
	- They are about 2 meters tall
- Sylvia steps so she will intercept the figure before they get to the camp and then asks if they need any help
- The figure gets off their horse and asks if Sylvia has a map, as they are going to Lashbend but are a bit lost
- Sylvia doesn’t have a map but gives vague directions
- The figure then splashes her with a liquid and kicks her to the ground (quite rude)
- Sylvia begins to rapidly lose consciousness
- The figure leans down and says that Nako sends his regards and pulls out a rope to tie her up
- Sylvia sacred flames one of “Fred”’s tents, then tries to get out a threat but loses consciousness before she can finish it
~Venti & Flendar Cam~
- It has been a few hours, and “Fred” says that he’d like to go get his supplies and bring them here
- Venti says she’ll go get his stuff, but “Fred” says he’s going too as it’s a nice day
	- Venti hesitates before agreeing about it going to be a nice day
~Trik Cam~
- (Time jump back to the previous day)
- Trik arrives back to his tribe and the Elder (I’m dropping the “the” after this for less words to type)
- Elder asks how it has been going, Trik replies its been going amazingly and not amazingly
- Trik asks if his note has arrived, Elder says it hasn’t
- Trik says he’s found a safer place/someone who can bring them to a safer place, and that person is a dragon
- All of the kobolds’ eyes light up
- Kiki (who is a jerk kobold who I guess y’all met in the first session) says that Trik is lying
- Trik says he isn’t and can prove it, as he was given the gift of speaking common
- Trik speaks common
	- Elder is shocked, confused, and amazed
- Trik then tells the tribe about tOO and where she is
- They are concerned about the journey that would need to be taken down to meet up with tOO
- Trik tries to convince the group to go, but Elder is worried and wants an escort 
- Trik offers that the group could help escort the tribe, but also that they can hire mercenaries if the tribe wants more help
- Trik uses sending to Venti telling her that he is with his tribe and that they would like an escort down to tOO
- Venti replies that she will see what they can arrange, but it might be difficult due to the group’s current situation, and Trik relays that to the tribe
- Trik also says that he will ask the church if they will send someone to help escort the tribe
- Trik then dos some stuff around town
	- Tries to get a refund from the messenger service, doesn’t get one
	- Talks to a blacksmith about fixing the squashed gold coins, the blacksmith says that he can’t but tells Trik he could likely get some money for the coins at a bank/counting house
~Pause on Trik Cam to go to Venti & Flendar Cam~
- Venti, Flendar, and “Fred” get back to “Fred”’s camp and see:
	- A burnt hole in “Fred”’s tent
	- A distinct lack of a Sylvia
	- Drag marks & horse tracks leading towards the north road
- Everyone agrees that this isn’t good
- Venti tries to track the horse but loses the trail soon after it hits the road
	- She is able to see that the tracks headed west
- Venti says that they should pack up “Fred”’s stuff and get it back to the castle before going out after Sylvia, and then they do just that
- Once they get back, “Fred” continues his work
	- All of the PPCs’ ooze is now silvery-blue
~Return to Trik Cam~
- More of what Trik does around town
	- Learns that there are no banks/counting houses in Nourishedvices, but there might be some in dwarven cities
	- Goes to the high priest of Nourishedvices and lets him know that his tribe will be moving out soon, and asks if the high priest can send someone to help escort them
		- The high priest says that he can send someone to help move them out, but can’t help outside of the town
- Trik then heads back to Sweepstrangers, where he is informed by Venti and Flendar that Sylvia has been kidnapped
- The group plans and preps to go out and find Sylvia
- Trik tries to send a message via sending to Sylvia but it fails
~Dramatic Cliffhanger~

## Sylvia Secret Session
- (Note: There is a possibility that the person who first poisoned Sylvia isn’t the one she fights in the cave, as their voices seemed different(first talked, second only seemed to grunt). However, I’m just gonna refer to both as kidnapper until that is confirmed)
- The next day, the poison wears off and Sylvia wakes up
- Her hands & feet are bound, she is gagged
- She is in a cave, sees her kidnapper
	- He isn’t paying attention to her
- She tests the rope on her hands and legs and starts to loosen them
- The kidnapper starts to take his mask off
	- Sylvia can’t see the front of his face, but he is a bird-like creature with similar feathers to Tiz & Shurie (gee golly, I wonder who it is?)
	- His feathers are sparse, the right side of his face has some feathers while the left side is bare
	- His head feathers and his head look like its had a chunk taken out of it (a big ol’ dent)
	- He is ~2m tall
- Sylvia starts to shuffle towards him, and he notices the noise and puts his helmet back on
- She tries to fake being unconscious, but fails
- He goes and gets another vial of the poison from a bag
- Sylvia gets her hands free, then ungags herself
- He throws the poison & hits, but she doesn’t fall to it
- Sylvia casts bless & spirit guardians, spirit guardians distract kidnapper while Sylvia gets free of all her bindings
- Sylvia sees her stuff and makes a run for it
- Kidnapper throws a spear and hits Sylvia
- Sylvia is able to get to her stuff, grabs her shield and warhammer
- Kidnapper grabs a shortsword
- Sylvia attacks kidnapper’s legs, leaving them bruised but not broken
- Sylvia tries to push to get to the bag of poisons, but fails 
- Kidnapper throws last poison, Sylvia stays conscious
- Sylvia tries to attack and fails
- Kidnapper uses a spell(Searing Smite) and his weapon glows white hot
	- (Note: This is likely why the troll’s decapitation wound was cauterized)
- He hits Sylvia hard and she goes down

- As she is losing consciousness, kidnapper uses a (potion or spell) that heals Sylvia to 1 HP but still leaves her unconscious
	- (I didn’t actually write this part down for some reason, so details are fuzzy)
- Sylvia wakes up again, this time laying in the snow
- The kidnapper’s horse is laying decapitated on the ground nearby
	- The horse also has parts of it eaten
- Lying unconscious on the horse is a naked female elf(current nickname: Ell), her hands and face covered in blood
	- She has lots of scars, some look recently healed, others look older
- Sylvia has no new injuries, but her chest is bruised
- Also nearby is Sylvia’s stuff, so she gets into her armor and also wraps the elf in her blanket
- Now not actively freezing to death, Sylvia looks at the surrounding area
- In the distance she sees a hillock with some chimney-esque smoke rising above it
- Sylvia wipes what she can of the blood off of Ell, builds a makeshift sled for Ell, and sets off towards the hillock
- As she gets closer, Sylvia can see that only one home has smoke coming from the chimney
- She approaches that house and knocks on the door, asking if she and her ally can come in
- An older male dwarf peeks at them through a sliding slit on the door, then lets them in
- He ushers Sylvia to bring Ell by the fire and then gives Sylvia some warm soup
- Sylvia and the dwarf chat
- The dwarf checks Sylvia’s rib and says that it is either broken or bruised

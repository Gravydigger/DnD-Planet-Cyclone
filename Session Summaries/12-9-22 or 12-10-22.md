- The group prepares to head to Bridgefame
	- The beakdogs are put in a stable and a week long stay is payed for
	- Some rations are purchased
	- Some non-ferrous weapons are purchased (silver and copper)
	- Spells are prepped
- The group heads to Bridgefame
- Jeremiah’s alibi plan works, and we get past the guards no problem
- Group + Jeremiah get into Bridgefame
- In the first room there is a warning written in blood on the wall
- Venti grabs a candle and uses light on it
~List of Traps that have been encountered~
- Door in a small hallway, when you try to open it fire traps activate and burn everything in the hallway
- Pressure plate at the start of a hallway that caused a gate to close in that same hallway, blocking forward movement that way
- Secret door in a wall with a nearby obscured trigger
- Hallway with very potent poison darts, triggered by a tripwire at the end of the hallway
- Hallway with magic tripwires that run floor to ceiling and connect to runes on the wall, which teleport whatever touches the tripwires
- Hallway with multiple pitfall traps in succession, so trying to dodge one leads to falling into the other
~Stuff that happened~
- Find a room with a whole lot of dead (cut in half) drifters in it, along with a Bellhop and a red-brown rift in the corner (think the rifts from Vintage Story)
	- The bellhop is trying to deal with the rift, and shoos/waves the group out of the room
	- Unknown if this is the same BH as the one encountered at Butterinked/Shakenheathers
- Find some rust monsters in a room attached to the fire trap hall, use the fire trap to burn some of them
- “The Hazelwood staff is wreathed in flames” - written on a wall in the room that the rust monsters were originally in
- In an adjacent hallway, find a demonic looking idol on a pedestal, doesn’t seem to be of anything anyone in the group knows of
- Flendar is hit by a poison dart (the dart trap was triggered by Ashro) and knocked out
	- Flendar is then healed with a potion
- Find a room with a mosaic of the dwarven goddess As Granitebronze the Cobalt Canyon
- Find stairs to the next level, but decide to finish off the first floor before going up
- Go back to the room with the BH in it, and ask the BH if we can pass through the room to get to a door on the opposite side
- The BH says yes and then nicely rips the opposite door open so we can get through
- On the other side is 8 giant centipedes, which we kill quickly
- After the centipede murder, we take a short rest
- Trik goes off on his own to search for treasure and do Trik stuff
- Find and experiment with the teleporting trap for a bit
- Ashro destroys one of the teleport runes on the wall, hoping to disable the trap
	- Instead, it causes a giant beam of teleporting magic to engulf the hallway, resulting in Ashro, Venti, and Flendar all being teleported
- The three end up a cell without any of their gear (now dressed in common clothes) in a different part of the dungeon
- Jeremiah and Sylvia retreat to a nearby room, Sylvia grabs a lantern from that room so she and Jeremiah can see
- Trik finds a room with windows to the outside, and the message “The curse can never be broken”
- Back with the three teleported, they are split between two cells but both cells have weaknesses that they exploit to break out
- Now free, the three encounter a giant fire beetle, who aren’t hostile unless attacked
*(Retconned events)*
- *Back to Trik, who breaks down a door to find a room with a puzzle requiring him to darken the room to cause a door to open*
- *On the other side of this door is a room with a bunch of coins and a potion that says it is for someone “weak in health and body”*
- *Trik takes the money and drinks the potion (gets +25 HP & +1 to con)*
- Back to the teleported trio, they go through a stone door and find a room with a stone throne in it
	- It is filled with fire beetles
	- On the throne is an old crown
- They move to the next room and find a single fire beetle who has swallowed a key
	- Flendar finds a button that causes a hidden door to open to another room
- They move to that room and find some staves, each take one
	- Room also has a tapestry of a god of illusions
- Flendar goes back to the throne room and grabs the crown
- The trio kills the single fire beetle and get the key from it, which allows them to unlock some barrels that had their stuff in it
- Back to Trik, who in his exploring finds the other side of the gate trap and the other side of the teleporter trap
- Back to Sylvia and Jeremiah, who go upstairs and then run into the teleported trio
- Trik rejoins the group, and the whole group enters a room with some statues in it
- The statues are actually gargoyles, who are fought and killed by the group
- Group makes it to a room with a mosaic of an ancient beast, a door with a face on it, and a hole in the floor that leads to a room on the lower floor that wasn’t accessible earlier
- Both Flendar and Ashro fall down, find money and an emblem of a deity
- Trik tries to tie a rope to the door with a face, but the door’s face animates and asks him not to
- The door then asks if he can ask Trik and Sylvia some questions, and when they say yes he asks them what color the sky is and what he is guarding
- The two do their best to answer the questions, but the door doesn’t know what many things are so much explaining is needed
- As they explain, Trik ties the rope to some rubble and lowers it into the hole so Flendar and Ashro aren’t stuck
- Sylvia descends to help Flendar and Ashro bring up the large amount of coins in the hole
- The money from the hole and also that Trik found earlier is deposited by the stairs (so it doesn’t cause people to be over encumbered)
- More chatting is done with the door, then the group goes to see what is behind the door
- Inside is a stone bust of a dwarf with an amulet on it
- Ashro and Sylvia both say not to pick up the amulet, Trik picks up the amulet anyway
- A hidden side door opens revealing a specter

- [[Tiz]] leaves the blacksmith and the group regroups to go meet up with Jeremiah
- Jeremiah invites the group to his home so they can talk in private about [[Bridgefame]]
~Heist planning starts~
- Info on [[Bridgefame]]
	- Was destroyed in 28
	- The only way to get in is through a tunnel north of Foundwheels
	- It’s a six hour journey from Foundwheels to any towns, so the group will need to be very prepared
	- The parts of the dungeon that aren’t underground are 300 ft above the ground, so don’t fall
	- There are a lot of traps, some on doors
	- There is a guard patrol at the fork in the tunnels
	- There was a cave-in in the tunnel, but it is rumored that someone was able to mine a hole through it
	- The roc that killed the former master of the WN is currently residing there
	- Has 4 accessible levels and has numerous creatures on each level
	- One of those creatures is a rust monster(see vc-text for info on the rust monster)
- Plan
	- Group preps a lot
	- When we are ready, Jeremiah will escort us to the fork in the tunnel and will tell the guards that the group has been tasked with clearing out [[Bridgefame]]
	- We hopefully get in and try not to die
	- When fighting the rust monster, use magical metal weapons or non-metal weapons
~Heist planning ends~
- [[Tiz]] is loaned weapons by Jeremiah

- Venti & Sylvia get up early(6am), eat breakfast, and to go the town’s temple to pray
- Ashro wakes up(7am), eats breakfast, and goes on a walk around town
- Tiz goes out to find the others and gets distracted by a butterfly(jk)
- Sylvia & Venti go back to the tavern after an hour and a half
- Flendar is at the tavern, eating breakfast
- Sylvia goes in, tells Flendar that she and Venti are outside then leaves to wait outside
- Ashro returns to the tavern and meets up with Sylvia & Venti
- He tells Venti & Sylvia about some of what happened the in the tavern the night before
	- Trik can speak Celestial
	- Shurie can help them get in contact with Berdan
- Ashro them goes into the tavern & talks to Trik, and asks him if he wants to speak to a god, Trik is hesitant
- Trik says he’ll do it only if the group helps him with his goal of moving his tribe to live near tOO
- Ashro agrees to find a messenger to get the message to Trik’s tribe
- Trik writes a message to the tribe elder
- Trik gives his message to Ashro, then Ashro, Sylvia, and Trik find a messenger
	- Normal delivery: ~ 1 week
	- Express delivery: 2-3 days
	- Cost for express pay is 30gp, Ashro pays
- After this, the three return to the tavern and pick up the rest of the group then go to Shurie’s house
- They knock on door, no one answers
	- Trik starts banging on door(thx nat 1)
- Sylvia finds a note from Shurie to Tiz & Co. under the doormat
	- It says she is either at the market or the hospital(quarantine zone?)
- Ashro uses telekinesis to pull Trik away from the door
- The group goes to the market first to see if Shurie is there
- Shurie is, in fact, at the market and is finishing up her shopping and doesn’t see the group
	- She is pecking at an apple
- After awkwardly debating who is going to be the social one of the group now that Tiz isn’t here, Sylvia goes up to Shurie and says hi, then is followed by Ashro and Trik
- Shurie greets the group then asks where Tiz is, everyone says idk
- Ashro asks about if Shurie has found a location for Trik to speak to the gods
- She says she can try, but needs to go drop off her shopping then will meet the group at the temple
- The group heads to the temple
- About 10 minutes later, Shurie arrives at the temple in her temple clothes
- Shurie leads the group to a door on a side wall of the temple, which leads to a small room with a shrine
	- (Note: Gravy gave us the job of describing how the room looked and I, PrincessInfluenza, leader of the Cult of Snark, was the one who ended up describing it, which was legit just me describing how a Snark shrine would look)
	- An altar sits opposite the door, with  a drawing of Berdan sitting on it. Also on the altar is a number of candles(not in holders, just sitting there) lit with normal fire, magenta fire, and blue/green fire. In front of the altar is a pillow for kneeling on. From the ceiling hangs multiple lanterns connected to the ceiling with chains, all also being lit with a mix of the three previously listed fires.
- Shurie kneels on the pillow and starts a prayer ritual
- After a few minutes, she signals Trik over
- Shurie says that she has brought a kobold that can speak celestial
- Trik is scared and doesn’t know what to say, Shurie whispers that he should introduce himself, which he does
- A moment passes, then Trik hears a voice(most likely Berdan)
	- It starts unintelligible but gets more understandable
- He asks Trik if he is a being who follows a religion
- Trik says yes
- Berdan replies that due to circumstances outside of his control, he can’t communicate with followers of religions
- Berdan then asks if any others in the group don’t follow a religion
- Trik says yes then asks the group if any of them don’t follow a religion
- Ashro & Flendar both say they don’t, then Trik points them out
- Berdan tells Trik he will talk with them
- Berdan then becomes audible Ashro & Flendar, and asks them if they follow a deity, they say no
- Rest of group can see that they are talking, but can’t hear what is said
- Berdan then shares that his is under an unwilling obligation not to talk with those who follow a deity, and can only speak with those who are dytheists(believe in gods but don’t worship them)
- Ashro says that Berdan probably can’t elaborate much on why
- Berdan then says that all the gods are under a “gag order” until an “audit” is done
- He also says that he respects the being who ordered the audit(and likely the gag order) but also cares about his followers’ wellbeing
- He shares that the Clockwork Infection(he calls it the Rot but I still think my name is cooler so I’m using it) is a curse, that something is coming to fix “mistakes”, and that it has gotten the attention of entities that shouldn’t be messed with
	- Berdan also confirms that he doesn’t know the being who made the mistakes
- He also shares that the Bellhop will not attack unless interfered with
- Berdan then tells Ashro & Flendar that if they have any questions, they should ask now
- Ashro asks if Berdan knows how the Clockwork Infection can be cured, he answers that that is something we need to figure out on our own
	- He also says he wishes he could do more to help his people, but his hands are tied
- In his head, Ashro says that he knows of an artifact(temporal gear) that could help, but he no longer has access to it
	- Berdan says that we might want to go track it down, but he can’t help
	- When Ashro name drops the Temporal Gear, Berdan says he isn’t familiar with it as it isn’t in his domain
- Berdan then asks Ashro to be vague when telling those of faith what was said, otherwise the information leak could be tied back to Berdan and that would put his followers in danger
- Ashro says he will try
- Flendar has been able to hear all of this conversation minus what Ashro said in his head & what Berdan replied
- Ashro says that is all of the questions he has, and Berdan says that he is sorry that he couldn’t be of more help
- Shurie asks what Ashro got, he says not much
- Ashro tells the the group that:
	- Berdan doesn’t know how to help
	- Something is coming(might be the Bellhop, might be something worse) and that it relates back to the mess at Shakenheathers
- Someone knocks at the door and ask Shurie if she is in the room
- Shurie opens the door and the person says that she needs to get over to the quarantine area (tone implied that something bad was happening)
- Shurie rushes off, the group follows
- They all get to the quarantine area and see the Bellhop entering and leaving tents
	- They are curing some of the infected and killing others
- In the center of the area is one of the Bellhop’s sword stuck into the ground with a time bubble around it
	- Inside are 3 soldiers, 2 dead
	- Shurie goes into the bubble, possibly to help the soldiers inside
- Venti observes:
	- The Bellhop entering a tent, moves over to the infected person and holds their hand out above them, doing some sort of magic(possibly to “scan” them for something), then magically pulling the metal shard out of their body and moving to the next tent
	- In the next tent, Bellhop does the same “scan” but this time makes a twisted “grr” noise then stabs the infected through the chest
	- There are no obvious traits separating those who are cured and those who are killed
- A guard runs up to the Bellhop and tries to hit them
- The Bellhop dodges and then slices the guard in half
- Ashro tries to talk to the Bellhop, who acknowledges that he is talking but just gets back to what they were doing
- Ashro pulls Shurie out of the time bubble
- As the Bellhop is finishing up, Venti accidentally ends up in their way(not aggressively), and the Bellhop just pushes her aside with the flat of one of their blades
- The Bellhop then walks into the time bubble and picks up their sword
- Sylvia casts detect magic, and sees that the Bellhop has magic from the temporal school of magic
- The casting of this spell gets the Bellhop’s attention, who turns towards Sylvia and gets into an attacking stance, but once they realize that the spell isn’t an attack, they relax some
	- Just in case, Sylvia moves back
- The Bellhop acts like they are searching for something
- Venti mentions going to check on the PPCs at Shakenheathers
- Upon healing the name Shakenheathers, the Bellhop whips around, goes up to Venti, then starts off towards Shakenheathers, getting progressively faster as they go
- Everyone in the group is like “Oh shit”
- Shurie asks what the matter is, the group quickly explains there are three more infected at Shakenheathers along with this one guy plot relevant guy, and all four of them are directly tied to what caused the infection in the first place
- Shurie bolts to a nearby stable and asks anyone if they can ride a horse, Venti and Sylvia say yes
	- Everyone gets on horses(Venti & Ashro, Shurie & Trik, Sylvia & Flendar)
- When the stable hand asks what's going on, Shurie says we need the horses for a church emergency
	- Ashro throws 20 gp at the stable hand
- The group rides off
- Venti is a fucking god at riding horses(2 nat 20s), Sylvia is very bad at it
- Venti is able to get ahead of the Bellhop
	- As she passes the Bellhop, they doesn’t react to them
- Venti & Ashro make it to Shakenheathers 30 minutes before the Bellhop
- Their poor horse collapses, but Venti heals it so it can get up and move to the river
- Venti bursts into Prax’s fishing hut to find Prax and Jaonos chatting
- Venti explains what is going on
- Prax says “fuck this shit I’m out” and leaves to go get on his boat
- Jaonos is like “hmm”, then grabs a bow and goes out to be ready to shoot shit
- Venti scolds Jaonos, Jaonos gets the idea to have Venti and Ashro take the PPCs on a rowboat out into the lake to try and protect them
- Venti and Ashro agree to help but both don’t know that it is going to work
- The two get out onto the lake with the PPCs while Jaonos stays on the shore(he sits down)
- Jenti uses Augury to get a read on what might happen, gets weal & woe(outcome that is both good and bad)
- The Bellhop arrives on the shore and begins to move around the lake, looking at the rowboat
- The Bellhop gets to Jaonos, who stands up and is immediately skewered by the Bellhop(‘tis merely a flesh wound)
- The Bellhop drop’s Jaonos’ body and starts to float out over water towards the rowboat
- Before they can get far, Jaonos’ body FUCKING BLOWS UP
	- This leaves a giant crater centered at where Jaonos was
- The Bellhop gets to experience first hand being yeet into next week
- A giant wave is created on the lake, and Venti turns the rowboat to protect it
- Prax can be seen on the lake, yelling
- As the other four reach edge of the town, they hear the explosion and feel the shockwave
- Tiz wanders into the scene, still chasing a butterfly(jk)

- The group investigates [[Jaonos]]’ room
	- An interesting(and very likely backstory relevant) book is found
	- It is under a spell that makes it so the reader can’t remember the text as soon as they look away(This was seen in the previous campaign, also used in relation to [[Jaonos]]’ story)
- The group tries a number of ways to try and get around the spell
	- Looking at the text in a mirror
	- Copying text to a separate sheet of paper
	- Reading the text out loud
	- No one in group can read it (the spell can allow certain people to read it)
- Group decides to travel to [[Shakenheathers]] to figure out what the actual fuck is going on
- But first, they travel to Frederick to see if he can help with the book
	- He is very distracted when the group gets there
	- He is also noticeably younger
- Frederick’s findings
	- The magic itself is on the text, not the book
	- It is illusion magic
	- Using dispel magic(on a copied version of a page) results in the text being wiped out
- Fred is invited to live in and continue his work in the castle, but declines for the moment
- Group goes back to castle
~[[Ashro]] shenanigans time~
- In the middle of the night, [[Ashro]] sneaks out and travels to where [[Fredrick]] is
- On the way, talks to the air(actually talking to his patron, from now on referred to as Karen)
- He arrives at [[Fredrick]]’s camp and shrouds himself in darkness
- At Karen’s order, cuts off [[Fredrick]]’s head and takes the temporal gear
- A sigil, likely connected to Karen, appears at the edge of the camp
	- [[Ashro]] places both [[Fredrick]]’s head and the gear in the sigil, and they disappear into the earth
	- Job complete!
- [[Ashro]] washes his hands and gear then returns to the castle
~Morning arrives~
- Everyone but [[Ashro]] gets ready
	- [[Ashro]] is still in bed
- [[Venti]] is a wonderful person and makes everyone food
- [[Ashro]] gets up and everyone eats
- The group plans in the war room then head out
	- The route is a long portion of road, then some underground tunnels, then more road
- About an hour away from the town at the entrance to the tunnel, a person can be heard singing a bit off the path
- The group agrees to go investigate, with [[Venti]], [[Ashro]], and [[Sylvia]] in the lead
- They find the singer who is actually part of a choir. An evil harpy choir.
- The lead harpy tries to charm [[Venti]], [[Ashro]], and [[Sylvia]]
- Only [[Ashro]] is charmed successfully
~Combat begins~
- Nat one count: 7.5(one was rolled in an advantage roll)
- The harpies get their asses kicked and all are killed
- [[Ashro]], [[Flendar]], and [[Sylvia]] search the harpies’ nest and find 2 gp(a great haul)
- [[Trik]] harvests and eats some harpy meat
	- The group has mixed reactions
- Finish traveling to the town at the entrance to the tunnels
- Get info, supplies, directions, and sleep(no scholar murder this night)
- The next day, the group ventures into the tunnels
- After about 6 hours, the group finds a suspicious door in the tunnel
- 83.3% of the group wants to keep moving, but [[Tiz]] forces open the door
- On the other side of the door is a room
	- Room amenities: a rotting floor(such soft floors!), glowing violet fungus on the walls(natural light!), and 2 Will o’ wisps(roommates to split the rent with! All of this could be yours for a monthly rent of 1,000,000 gp!)
- [[Tiz]] backs up from the door, and [[Ashro]] & [[Sylvia]] peek in
	- All of them get bad vibes
- The wisps try to beckon [[Tiz]] in, attempting to entice him with a dead body, a sword, and some money
- Everyone agrees to leave and [[Tiz]] closes the door
- The group gets to the mid-point town and keeps going
- They get to the town on the other side of the tunnels, where they stay the night in the tavern
- The group argues with [[Tiz]] about how he shouldn’t sleep on a bench outside and that one of them will just pay for his room
	- [[Tiz]] is a stubborn little shit and refuses
	- [[Trik]] slips [[Tiz]] 50 gp, and informs [[Ashro]] that he did this
- [[Sylvia]] is tired and gets a room to sleep in
- [[Tiz]] goes out to sleep on a bench, but [[Trik]] and [[Ashro]] use magic to force him to go upstairs and sleep in a room
	- He ends up going to [[Sylvia]]’s room and laying down on her floor
	- [[Sylvia]] is not phased by the bird man sleeping on her hotel room floor and gives him a blanket and pillow
	- [[Ashro]] stops by to offer a blanket and pillow for [[Sylvia]]
	- [[Sylvia]] goes the fuck to sleep
- [[Venti]] drinks a hell of a lot, then passes out in a room at some early ass hour
~The next day~
- The group minus [[Venti]] meet downstairs and start getting some food
- [[Sylvia]] goes up to check on [[Venti]], who is passed out on her bed
	- [[Sylvia]] lets her sleep for another hour
	- She also checks to make sure the Jompass is still pointing where they are expecting it to point
- The group banters for a bit
	- [[Tiz]] finds out he is ‘magically’ no longer broke
- [[Tiz]] and [[Sylvia]] go up to wake up [[Venti]]
- [[Tiz]] uses magic to instantly sober up [[Venti]]
	- [[Tiz]] and [[Sylvia]] then leave to let [[Venti]] get ready
- [[Venti]] comes downstairs and the group continues to [[Shakenheathers]]
- About an hour from the town, some wooden and metal shrapnel from what looks like an explosion litter the ground
	- They all look to have come from [[Shakenheathers]]
- The closer the group gets to the town, the more shrapnel there is
- The group arrives at the outskirts of the town to see that is trapped inside a giant dome of transparent shadows(the Shadome)
- [[Tiz]] runs ahead in to the Shadome, and [[Ashro]] chases after him
	- Both enter the Shadome
- They are both ‘frozen’ in time by a wave of shadow that originated at the center of the Shadome
- With the Jompass out(and shaking violently), the rest of the group enters the Shadome
	- [[Venti]] is holding the Jompass
- The Jompass creates a protective sphere around the group that protects them from the shadow waves
- The group begins to walk through the town towards its center
- They observe that basically everything is frozen in a stasis
	- There is an unfrozen(I think) group of soldiers fighting a group strange twisted creatures(from now on referred to as drifters)
- [[Ashro]] and [[Tiz]] are rescued from the stairs by being pulled into the Jompass’ safety bubble
- [[Tiz]] shares that he knows/knew the people of [[Shakenheathers]]
- The group arrives at the edge of the epicenter of the Shadome
- The epicenter:
	- Is surrounded by a wall of hundreds of drifters
	- Has three unconscious humanoids on the ground
		- The elf, dwarf, and kobold from [[Jaonos]]’ backstory dome
		- They are on death’s door
	- Has a floating humanoid cloaked in shadowy fire at the dead center(currently known as Shadnos)
		- I’d be surprised if this wasn’t [[Jaonos]] tbh
- [[Tiz]] throws the Raxe at Shadnos, the Raxe gets frozen when it enters the Shadome
- [[Sylvia]] casts a healing spell on the three unconscious figures, the magic gets frozen when it enters the Shadome
- [[Venti]] moves the safety bubble forward, so it now encompasses the three unconscious figures and also Shadons
- The Raxe hits Shadnos, making him fall to the ground and let out a scream
- [[Sylvia]]’s magic hits the three figures, stabilizing them
- The drifters react to the scream
~Combat prob will begin(jk no it didn’t)~

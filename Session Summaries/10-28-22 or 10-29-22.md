- Right after the explosion
	- Prax is mad
	- The Bellhop is consumed in fire
	- Shrapnel rains from the sky
- Sylvia is hit on the head by shrapnel but manages to not fall unconscious
- Shakenheathers is now rubble
- Sylvia, Flendar, Trik, & Shurie arrive at the edge of the crater
- Venti & Ashro’s horse is seen laying on the ground under a collapsed wooden wall, injured but alive
- Sylvia heals the horse, then she, Shurie, and Flendar move the wall
- The horse runs away
- Trik checks the crater and sees a golden rift(vertical tear) on a little island in the middle of the crater
- Trik also sees the BH (The Bellhop, I just don’t feel like writing out their name like 50 times again), frozen in the air over the crater/lake, twitching/glitching and pulling particles into their body
- Shurie & Sylvia go down into the crater to approach the rift
	- The rift is made of divination magic
- They hear two voices, one male(MV) and one female(FV), both vaguely older sounding
	- The two seem to be arguing in common, but words can’t be made out
	- (My current guess is Adhas(or Soar, but I think Adhas is more likely) & Ber Zan)
- Sylvia clls out to the voices in the rift
- The bickering stops for a moment, then MV answers
- He says (the following quotes in this conversation aren’t direct quotes but close) “Oh good, its two ways. There isn’t much time.”
- Then tells us to go find someone who can do Temporal magic, Sylvia replies that the group knows someone who can do Temporal magic(if he was alive but she don’t know that)
- He says “Bad stuff is happening here & there”
- FV speaks and says that they shouldn’t have sent them
- Sylvia asks the the “them” was a group of four adventurers
- FV asks if one of the adventures was a male elf, Sylvia asks if said elf had brown hair with a white streak, and FV confirms
- The rift begins to collapse
- MV says “ Unless all but 1 Jaonos remains, shit will be bad”, and the portal collapses
- Sylvia and Shurie exit the crater
- Tiz arrives in a hurry and on a horse
	- Jumps off his horse to get to the group
- Sylvia casually gets over her minor concussion, as ya do
- Tiz asks wtf is going on here, Shurie replies that we don’t know and are trying to figure that out
- As a precaution, Sylvia tells Tiz not to fight BH unless he wants to be chopped in half
- Shurie asks where Tiz has been, he doesn’t answer
- Ashro rows up to the island in the middle of the crater(that has now filled with water)
- Ashro explains Jaonos exploded and caused the crater, Tiz is angry and comments something about never wanting to see Jaonos again(or something with a similar vibe, I don’t remember what exactly was said)
- Sylvia says he’s gonna have to, as they are now actively looking for alternate versions of Jaonos
	- (HAHA I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE MULTI-JAONOS THEORY! BWAHAHA)
	- Upon hearing this, Tiz continues to be angry and Ashro is confused
- Tiz then turns to the BH then glares and yells at them
- Tiz refers to BH & Jaonos as friends, Ashro disagrees
- Tiz and Ashro both see that BH is in the process of regenerating
- Tiz also sees Prax sitting on the side of the crater and looking sad, but doesn’t really process it
- Tiz picks up a rock and yeets it at BH
	- Ashro goes to run away, Sylvia tries to rush to Tiz and stop him but doesn’t make it
- The rock passes right through BH
- Ashro then reminds the group about the PPCs, and Sylvia asks if they are still infected, which Ashro says they are
- The group all agrees that they need to move the PPCs north to Sweepstrangers
	- Tiz suggests using the row boat as a cart, the group debates
- Tiz goes over to talk to Prax, and asks him what happened
- Prax tells Tiz what happened from his perspective, and includes that BH walked strait up to Jaonos and stabbed him
- Tiz asks Prax where he is staying, Prax says that he has his little house/hut on the side of the lake, but also comments that he isn’t sure if it is safe anymore
	- Tiz reiterates his earlier offer of coming north with them
- Tiz asks if Prax knows of a way to transport the PPCs, Prax says that he found a cart that wasn’t completely destroyed that they can use
- Prax then leads Tiz to the cart and tells him that he’ll need a bit to collect his things from his hut, then he’ll join them
- Tiz walks back to the group and informs them that Prax has a cart they can use
- Prax returns with his stuff and the cart, and the PPCs are loaded in
- Shurie is asked what she will be doing, and says that she will need to return to Butterinked to explain everything that has happened
	- She also says that she will take a look for the horse as she heads back
- (At this point I realize that Jaonos’ magically encoded book has probably been destroyed and make a bet that if I roll a nat 20 on perception Syl finds it. I did not roll a nat 20)
- Ashro is able to estimate that BH will regenerate in about 2 days
- The group finishes packing up and leaves, using Tiz’s, Sylvia’s, and Shurie’s horses to pull the cart
- On the road, Sylvia brings up that they should go give Fredrick a visit as soon as they can, the group agrees
- Group pushes to get to Scourwhips (Trik & Tiz get an exhaustion but it doesn’t really end up mattering)
- Tiz once again doesn’t want to sleep in the tavern, Ashro tries to use suggestion on him but the bird resists
- Prax goes to join Tiz, but after a conversation Tiz and Prax both agree to sleep in the tavern only so Tiz can say he slept in one once and doesn’t have to do it ever again if he doesn’t like it
- The next morning, Prax & Tiz both wake up at 6 am
- They chat about a range of things, including how they didn’t like how soft the beds were and that neither of them really have money for food, so they’ll just skip breakfast
- Sensing that someone is skipping breakfast, both Ashro and Sylvia bolt up out of bed and quickly head down
- Upon getting downstairs, Prax gives the two a look, but Sylvia just stares back with a look of I’m going to help you, whether you like it or not
- Through extreme mom friend shenanigans and also intimidation(but in like a caring way), Sylvia gets both Prax and Tiz to order some food, and she pays for it
- Prax is intimidated by Sylvia’s sheer caring, intensity, and also mom-voice
- Eventually Flendar & Trik wake up, everyone gets breakfast, and the group continues
- The group passes the wisp door and see that there was a cave in, which killed some local kids
	- The bird feels responsible
- The group gets back to Sweepstrangers
- Tiz tries to confront Flendar about the whole being friends with a dragon thing
- Flendar says nah and tries to walk away
- Tiz isn’t taking no for an answer and presses Flendar
- Flendar asks why Tiz wants to know, Tiz calls dragons “creatures of destruction that can murder more than we can breathe in a day” (Which is just kinda sus backstory wise)
- Flendar says that Tiz must not know much about dragons
- Flendar and Tiz argue more
- Tiz asks where Flendar even found a dragon, Flendar says that he come from a place where dragons are common
- When asked where that is, Flendar says he doesn’t remember where his homeland is, and upon further questioning reveals that he isn’t sure how old he is, but thinks he is 20 - 25
- Flendar says that he has traveled a lot and forgot due to traveling
- Tiz counters with the fact that he has been traveling since he was 3 or 4, and hasn’t forgotten that kinda stuff
- Flendar shares that he has lost a lot of things in his travels, not his memory directly but things that are more important in his memory
	- (Very interesting possible future lore implications)

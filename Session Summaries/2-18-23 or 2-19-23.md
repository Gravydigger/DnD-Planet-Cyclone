- Shifts are taken overnight due to being so close to Cruelstirs
	- Sylvia and Venti take the last shift
- The two hear someone running towards Chantstaves
- They go to check and see a goblin carrying another goblin
	- The one who is carrying the other is heavily exhausted
	- The one being carried is heavily frostbitten
- The goblins turn east but soon collapse
- Sylvia and Venti decide to head inside
- After everyone wakes up, Sylvia & Venti tell the group about what they saw
- Jaquelo guesses that they were refugees from Cruelstirs
- The group decides to go check on the goblins
	- The originally unconscious goblin is dead
	- The other is unconscious from exhaustion, and will die without intervention
- The group decides to bring the goblins to a nearby monastery and see if they will take the unconscious goblin and bury the dead one
- When they get there, Jaquleo knocks on the door and talks to the dwarves inside
	- They say they don’t have space
- The group heads back to Chantstaves and leaves the goblins in a house
	- The unconscious goblin is wrapped in a blanket and fed a health potion
- The group decides to make some potions before going to Cruelstirs
	- Much of the group helps find ingredients
	- Venti makes 3 greater healing potions and two potions of spell regeneration, then distributes them to the group
- The group then heads straight for Cruelstirs
- They try to sneak in but get insta-caught (group stealth of -7 ftw)
- 5 spotlights are pointed at the group, and goblins in nearby towers have their bows knocked but not drawn
- Flendar tries to communicate with one of the tower goblins through a spell, but can’t understand the answer
- A spell is cast and the group begins to sink into the ground slightly before being teleported into a bare stone room
- Nako’s voice echoes from the corners of the room
- Nako monologues (rough quotes)
	- “I have spent months planning your capture”
	- “At no point did I consider you arriving at my doorstep”
	- “I didn’t expect you to lay into my hand so easily”
	- “Let’s not waste this opportunity”
- Nako makes a comment about Sylvia not being with the group
	- He likely can’t see her due to the anti-tracking amulet
- Nako then tells us not to die and the door to the dungeon is unlocked with a click

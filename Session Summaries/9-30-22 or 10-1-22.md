- Shadnos and drifters cover their ears as a chiming bell is heard
- In the distance, a six armed being (nickname: Bellhop) enters the scene
	- (Not describing its appearance, just check vc-text)
	- In one hand holds a bell that it is ringing
	- In another, holds a lantern with a temporal gear inside of it
	- In the other four, holds swords
	- Is moving generally towards the center of the Shadome but not towards the group
- Light from the Jompass slams into Shadnos and begins to work its way through his body
- Shadnos stands up and does something(either let out another scream or had a flash of light come from his body)
- This attracts the attention of Bellhop, who focuses on him/the group and rushes over
- As it is moving towards us, the Shadome begins to fade
	- Bellhop becomes transparent and then disappears
	- Any surviving drifters die
	- Jaonos, who is now shadow free, falls unconscious
	- Time resumes
- Sylvia casts detect magic and finds no unexpected magic
- Venti & Tiz take the Raxe out of Jaonos’ shoulder and heal the wound
- The three unconscious non-Jaonos humanoids(from now on referred to as the PPCs aka Past Player Characters) are:
	- (Note: I will be including the name of these characters but they aren’t known by any of us)
	- A female elf with dark gray skin, orange-blonde hair, and in leather armor (Kathra) 
	- A female dwarf, well endowed, caucasian with brown hair, and in magical garb (Myrtle)
	- A male kobold with orange scales and in thieves garb (Vipre)
- Ashro sees that the PPCs all have black wounds on their chests
- The four unconscious people are brought into a nearby non-smoldering boat house
- Tiz ties Jaonos’ wrists and ankles with fishing line
- Lots of info on the infection the PPCs have(I’ve put the info in Other Important Info: The Clockwork Infection)
- Sylvia, Venti, and Ashro go out to see if there are survivors that need help
	- Don’t find any living people in the town
	- Humanoid bodies found are mostly soldiers and some merchants
	- Lots of drifter corpses
- Flendar, Trik and Tiz hear a boat being pulled up on the shores of the lake, then footsteps coming towards the boat house
- The door to the boat house opens and an elf walks in
- His name is Praxum(Prax) and he and Tiz know each other
	- He is a fisherman and this is his boat house
- Sylvia, Venti, and Ashro return, and Tiz introduces the whole group to Prax
- Prax is confused, Tiz is nervous and awkward
- Prax goes out to work on something and Tiz joins him
- Kathra becomes conscious, but is in a delirious/sick state so isn’t actually conscious
- Prax informs the group that most of the people of Shakenheathers ran south before the Shadome went up
- Prax is also shown a drifter body, as he hadn’t seen one yet
- After seeing all this, Prax decides to go back on on the lake
- He isn’t super happy with us staying in the boat house, but also isn’t gonna kick us out
- Prax recommends going south to Butterinked for info and stuff
- As he is leaving, Tiz offers that Prax can come stay up in Sweepstrangers if he needs a place to stay
- Tiz, who has had a pretty rough day, sits down and lets out a big sigh
	- He now realizes that the boat house is familiar
	- Finds his name carved on the wall
- The group takes a long rest
- All PPCs are conscious but delirious, one has a fever that Sylvia is trying to get down
- Jaonos wakes up
- Tiz is the first to notice and looks upset
- Tiz shares that he lived in Shakenheathers for many years and is angry at Jaonos for the town’s destruction
- Jaonos shares that the last thing he remembers is the spar with Tiz and getting angry(around the time of Tiz uppercutting him)
	- Says “I got angry, didn’t I?”(v sus in my opinion)
- Sylvia, Tiz and Venti all describe some of the events that have occurred since Jaonos’ last memory
- Jaonos doesn’t know what town he is in
- When told he is in Shakenheathers, he says he doesn’t know the town
- Sylvia confronts him about when he brought up going to Shakenheathers then backtracked (when the group got back from the trip to the Playful Waters)
- Jaonos diverts the conversation and asks about the PPCs
	- Venti says that they are alive
	- Sylvia and Tiz glare at him
- Jaonos asks if the PPCs have black wounds
- When we confirm they do, he says oh shit and decides he needs to give some exposition on wtf is going on
- Asks if we want the long or short version of the story
	- Tiz says long
- Jaonos warns that some of the information might not be in order 
~Exposition Dump~
- Jaonos and the PPCs aren’t from this world
- They had accepted a job in their world that was very similar to the one we got from Fredrick
- They went into a similar Dungeon of Time
	- The location gave him the heebie jeebies
- They picked up the temporal gear and then shit got real weird
- A shining being with no face and lots of arms(Bellhop) showed up, and they ran
- They got out of the Dungeon, and found themselves in the middle of nowhere
	- PPCs were also infected with rusted shards as they left
- They journeyed and ended up finding Shakenheathers
- Bellhop ended up following them, leading to the town being overrun with drifters
- Jaonos remembers his amulet protecting him from something, and some force blasting away the drifters(likely referring to the flashback where Jaonos exploded in light)
- Bellhop was doing damage control for something
	- Not drifters or Jaonos & the PPCs
- It wasn’t Jaonos & the PPCs intent to have the town invaded, they were just trying to find a way home that didn’t involve getting attacked by the Bellhop
- When questioned about the version of Jaonos who was with us, he said:
	- He didn’t remember how he became an advisor to Nourishedvices Baron
	- He has some memories of both being an advisor in Nourishedvices and doing odd jobs there
- The group asks about the magically encoded book we found
- Jaonos comments he can’t really look at it while still being bound
- Venti goes to take off the bindings, Sylvia and Ashro move to be prepared to stop Tiz from rushing at Jaonos once his bindings are off
- Venti gives Jaonos the book
- Jaonos confirms it is his and that the magic is also his, but it is based off of someone else’s
	- (None of the characters know this, buth that someone else is his adopted mother, Ber Zan aka Plant Mom)
- However, Jaonos doesn’t actually remember writing the book, which is actually a journal about what the advisor Jaonos did
- Jaonos feels like only a week has passed since he and the PPCs got here, and continues to be confused when he learns a version of him has been with us for over a year
- Venti gets a chair and some water for Jaonos, who is still just very confused(to be fair, there are a lot of time/space shenanigans going on)
- The group agrees that we should go talk to Fredrick about this asap, and also that we will need a cart to safely transport the PPCs
- Prax returns, and tells the group they will need to go to Butterinked to get a cart
- Prax learns his own cart was destroyed, and proceeds to rant angrily to no one in particular about it for a bit
- Sylvia offers to stay behind as the rest of the group goes to Butterinked so she can continue to care for the PPCs
	- Ashro and Tiz help activate her logical brain cell so she agrees to go to Butterinked as well
- Jaonos says he will stay back, to which Tiz says hell no
- Jaonos (somewhat threateningly) explains that him going with them would be a bad idea (in case he turns into a nightwalker or a Shadome again)
- Tiz huffs and says Jaonos can do what he wants
- Prax, now done being angry about his cart, offers to cook up the fish he caught while out before the group leaves, which everyone agrees to
- Prax and Tiz go off to prepare the food
	- Tiz gets some barrels from the cellar of the tavern for the group to drink
- Sylvia gives Jaonos three health potions she had still been carrying
- The food is done and the group chows down
- Most stay out on the beach, but Sylvia takes her food and goes back to the boathouse, claiming she should be keeping an eye on the PPCs
	- Prax comments on Sylvia running off to Tiz
- Jaonos goes for a swim

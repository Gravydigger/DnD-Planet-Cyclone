- (Note: I’m going to be using they/them for the Corrector, but he/him for when they are in the “Fred” form. If this gets too confusing, I can change it in the future.)
~Very Short Flashback~
- What the other three did during downtime the previous week
	- Trik: Helped out his tribe
	- Flendar: Had an existential crisis
	- Venti: Made potions
~End flashback~
- It is the morning after Sylvia, Tiz, and Ashro broke into “Fred”’s room
- Everyone (except maybe Venti) is chilling in the war room
	- The three who broke in share what they found
- Trik sneaks behind “Fred” to see his reaction when he enters his room after being out
	- “Fred” immediately knows something is up and sighs (in an “oh” sorta way)
	- He unlocks and walks into his room, then slams the door shut
- Trik returns to the war room to inform the others of what he saw
- (Note: Lots of debate happened on what we are doing next, we end up deciding to deal with “Fred” first)
- Ashro gets a set of keys for “Fred”’s room from John (our butler) 
- Sylvia casts detect magic and senses a nearly overwhelming amount of temporal magic from “Fred”’s room
	- It is centered at where the footprints were, so most likely where “Fred” is standing
	- She also senses 4 abjuration spells
- Trik casts pass without trace, and together he and Sylvia dispel all of the abjuration spells
- Sylvia warns the others about the temporal magic, then Ashro opens the door
- “Fred” is in the middle of the room, eyes glowing blue, head twitching, and holding two orbs (one in each hand)
	- He also has see-through heads showing him at different ages (infant, child, old, dead)
- His book is open on its stand, with a magic “ribbon” with runes on it coming out of the book, going around “Fred”, then going back into the book
	- He is doing some kind of spell, which is wrapping up quickly
	- Ashro (with help from Karen) is able to tell that “Fred” knows that we are here, and he tells the rest of the group
- Ashro uses mage hand to grab “Fred”’s book off of its stand and then closes it, breaking the spell before it can finish
- “Fred” breaks apart for a moment, before reforming back into his true form, the Bellhop/Corrector (major “oh shit” moment) and looking very unhappy
- The book is magically being pulled back towards the Corrector, but Ashro holds onto it
- Ashro tries to bargain, asking if we can just talk then he’ll give the book back
- The Corrector magically pulls at the book again, and Ashro decides to surrender it
- It flies over to the Corrector, who grabs it then tells us to speak
- (Note: Some of this will include the questions the group asked the Corrector, and the rest will just be the info we received)
- Ashro asks what’s going on, the Corrector shares that after Fredrick died, they took up the facade of “Fred” to keep an eye on the group/make sure the group doesn’t cause trouble again, and also because they noticed we were protective of the PPCs
- The spell the Corrector was doing was to keep up the form of “Fred”
- There is only one Corrector in this universe, meaning this is the same one we saw at Shakenheathers, Butterinked, in Bridgefame, and who saved Tiz
- Ashro asks if this has something to do with the Jaonoses being split
- Our & the PPCs/Jaonos’ universes have been connected in an unstable way
	- The universes are trying to separate but are being tied together by the Jaonoses
	- Significant damage is being done to both universes
	- PPCs are causing the instabilities, but can’t be returned until only one Jaonos remains
	- (Note: There was a metaphor about a button up shirt and the universes, but I honestly didn’t get to write it down so I only remember bits.)
		- Each side of the shirt is a universe
		- The Jaonoses are the buttons
		- “Unbuttoning” all of the buttons/Jaonoses would save/fix the universes
- The Corrector has been doing magic to keep our universe stable
- Flendar asks what the best way to solve the Jaonos problem is, the Corrector shares that the Jaonoses have been magically hiding/hidden from them, and that the Jaonoses EITHER have to be killed or merged
- The Corrector has only found 2 Jaonoses (DT! and presumably Advisor!), and doesn’t know how many there are left
- The Corrector believes that foul play (by Nako and Jaquelo) is likely involved in the Jaonoses being hidden
	- They are using magic they don’t understand
	- The Corrector doesn’t know exactly what they are doing
- If things aren’t fixed, both affected universes go bye bye
- Finding Jaonoses is the main priority, but dealing with Jaquelo and Nako would allow the Corrector to work faster
- Lowering the number of Jaonoses won’t extend the time that our universe has left
- Ashro asks how much someone with access to a temporal gear could worsen the situation (gee I wonder why), The Corrector says that it would greatly worsen the situation
	- If the being with the gear was able sever the universe and force the Corrector out, which would keep any of the beings who keep time-space stable (like the Corrector) and allow the being to do what they want with the world 
- Flendar asks about how the Corrector knew Fredrick was dead, the Corrector shares that they found him dead and buried him, then to continue continuity, they disguised themself as “Fred”
- When asked if they could tell us what happened to Fredrick, they say that they won’t in order to preserve group cohesion
- Sylvia asks if the Corrector will be staying as “Fred”, they say that they will in order not to arouse suspicion, and also that they might need our help with stuff
- The Corrector also says that if we have any questions on the Jaonoses, we can ask them when they are present
- They then summon a glowing mask and don it, turing back into “Fred”, but allow us to continue asking questions
- He is asked about the curing process for the Clockwork Infection
	- All of the people who were infected fell into rifts
		- The only possible exception is that one guy who infected himself by force, might need to ask on that one
	- The Corrector pulled them out using the shards, but sometimes missed the actual person and hit something else in the rift (a memory or a construct)
		- The ones who were cured were the actual people who fell in
		- The ones who were killed weren’t the actual people, and the actual people are essentially dead
- He is then asked if the PPCs are all the actual ones and he says yes, because this world is their “rift”
- Ashro then asks how the rift formed that brought the PPCs and Jaonos here, and he says that he doesn’t know but once things stabilize it will be investigated
- Ashro also asks about what the drifters are
	- They are the result of others who came to fix things before the Corrector, but couldn’t fix things in time
- When asked how dangerous the drifters are to a person/reality, he says that they are an issue, but they represent a symptom of a larger problem
- Sylvia asks about the golden rift that formed after DT!Jaonos exploded
	- “Fred” originally dismisses it as just something that can happen
	- Finds it interesting when informed that there were voices on the other side of the rift that seemed to be from the other universe, as he didn’t know about them
- (Note: These next questions/info are from the retcon allowing Tiz to participate in the asking of questions)
- Tiz asks “Fred” why he rescued him from the rift, and is told that it was in “Fred”’s best interest, both to try and avoid losing this universe’s inhabitants to the time-space disaster and also to keep the group from spending time searching for him in vain
	- The rift appeared in a dark alley and it wasn’t a coincidence that it appeared there
- When asked if there is any way for us to help deal with/close rifts, “Fred” says that we don’t have the power to do anything to the rifts
	- However, it would help “Fred” if we locate any Jaonoses or deal with the people who are causing the Jaonoses to be hidden
- If “Fred” finds any Jaonoses, he will be trying to merge them but if the situation gets too complex, he will kill them
- When asked what happened with DT!Jaonos before he blew up, “Fred” shares that he lost his temper which is why he killed Jaonos
	- He also cautions against killing Jaonoses, as it will just lead to the remaining ones getting more cautious and paranoid, which will make finding them harder
	- The Jaonoses also appear to have safeguards against death
- The Corrector doesn’t have an official name, so we should just call him Fredrick for now
- “Fred” is done being questioned so shoos the group out of the room and then shuts the door
- The group then goes back to the war room and are joined by Venti, who they then fill in on the situation

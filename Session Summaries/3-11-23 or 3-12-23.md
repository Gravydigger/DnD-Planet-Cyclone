- The group exits the room they were teleported to
- The room they enter has two birthing pool vats that are surrounded by glass
	- There are grates on the ceiling above the vats
	- Walls of force are protecting the glass
- When anyone (but Sylvia) gets near the glass, the liquid in the vats starts to move towards them
	- The liquid doesn’t react to Sylvia
- One of the grates opens to reveal a hobgoblin holding a young human girl (Lilac)
	- The hobgoblin throws the girl in, and the liquid melts her down
- The group enters the next room, which has two large birthing pools in it, along with a number of exits/hallways branching off of it
	- On the far side of the room is a terminal with a lectern in front of it
	- The center birthing pool is diluted and has a button (C) at the bottom of it
	- The north birthing pool had a button (N) suspended on a platform above it
- The hallways to the left of the center room have a number of pressure plates that shoot out poisoned darts
	- At the northern end of the hallways is a small pool of birthing pool liquid with a ramp leading down into it
	- At the southern end of the hallways is a button (W)
- The room to the right of the center room is set up like a tower defense game, with us as the “attacking” group
	- The path through goes up then doubles back a number of times before getting to a button (E)
	- The path is defined by walls of iron bars
	- A handful of goblins hide on the other side of the final wall of iron bars, attacking those who come in the room
		- When the group first enters this room, combat happens and all the goblins are either killed or scared off
~Puzzle Info~
- An encoded order of the buttons is shown on the terminal
	- The four digit number at the beginning of the sequence gives the location of the encoded letter
	- The count starts at 0, similar to many programming languages
- Once the order is decoded, the buttons need to be pushed and then held in that order
- N, E, & W buttons all had timed traps associated with them, requiring the buttons to be pressed quickly
	- N: As soon as the button is pressed, the platform descends into the birthing pool
	- E: As soon as the button is pressed, the door to the room locks and birthing pool liquid slowly begins to flow through the room
	- W: idk?
- If any of the buttons were released before all buttons were pressed, the key resets
- C is always listed last
~End puzzle info~
- First attempt at puzzle
	- Order: NEWC
	- Mostly just a test
	- Ashro presses and holds N (with mage hand) until it sinks fully into the liquid and the puzzle resets
- Second attempt at the puzzle 
	- Order: EWNC
	- Tiz presses and holds E, triggering that rooms trap and surprising everyone
	- Jaquelo runs and hits W (maybe triggering a trap but I didn’t get what it was)
	- Ashro uses mage hand to hit N
	- Sylvia dives into the center pool and hits C
	- All four buttons glow and all the traps stop
	- The two doors to the south unlock
- While in the diluted liquid, Sylvia isn’t melted down but instead feels stronger
- Sylvia swims out and is helped out of the liquid by Flendar
	- The liquid drains some hp from Flendar and transfers it to Sylvia
	- Once she gets out, she also gets a feeling of evil but shakes it off
- After seeing its effects, the group decides to bottle up a bit of the diluted liquid
	- Sylvia originally objects, but is convinced that it could be useful in the future by Jaquelo
- Tiz gets the idea to go bottle up some of the non-diluted liquid from the small pool in the hallway
- He succeeds but Sylvia gets frustrated that he put himself in danger to get something she could have safely gotten
	- The frustration is amplified as an effect of her going into the diluted pool
- In her frustration, Sylvia punches Tiz and does a lot of damage
	- Side effect of having gone into the diluted pool
	- Punch basically ignores armor
- Sylvia comes back to her senses and looks horrified at what she did
- Nako come on over the magic intercom and starts monologuing about strength and power and all that kind of evil villian bullshit
- Sylvia dispels the magic intercom while telling Nako to shut up
	- Another intercom activates and Nako says that they’ll see each other soon enough
- (Note: Jaquelo has only seen Nako use the diluted liquid to power up)
- The group takes a short rest before going into the boss battle
	- Sylvia sits in the corner of the center room, hugging her knees to her chest and crying
	- Ashro, Jaquelo, and Flendar all sit by her
		- Flendar gives her a pat on the back
	- As the hour is coming to a close, Jaquelo give Sylvia a pep-talk
		- Talks about nature vs nurture (but in like a kind, uplifting way)
		- Reminds her that Nako purposely set up the puzzle to force Sylvia to go into the liquid
		- Says they need to press on
		- He then takes off her hood, gives her a pat on the head and then a hug
	- Jaquelo then goes to scout ahead a bit
	- Sylvia composes herself and stands up, leaving her hood down
		- (real season finale energy pt 1)
- Jaquelo returns and shares that both the southern doors lead to the same room, which has a portal in it
- The group enters the portal together
~Dramatic Boss Fight Time~
- Arena is a large circular platform above a larger pool of birthing pool liquid
- Nako, a Booyah (goblin sorcerer), and another goblin (didn’t get its name) stand around the platform, equally spaced out
	- Also Nako has a little Imp
- Nako paces and monologues for a bit, before turning his attention to Ashro
- Nako talks to Ashro about their mutual benefactor (Karen) and all of the perks Ashro would get if he joins forces with Nako
- Nako has done his research on Ashro
- Ashro refuses to join Nako, so Nako orders the other goblins to kill the group, but says that Sylvia is his to kill
~Combat Starts~
- Ashro tries to call on Karen’s luck, but they say nah
- Flendar takes out the booyah sorcerer immediately
- Nako has made the entire boss arena hallowed ground, so the whole group is vulnerable to fire damage
- Nako immediately traps Sylvia in an illusion magic spell (I don’t remember the name but boy did it suck)
- The other goblin mini-boss casts a wall of fire that knocks out both FLendar and Sylvia
- Nako gets pissy that the mini-boss knocked out Sylvia, so he kills them
- Ashro gets knocked unconscious
- Tiz gets Sylvia up
- (Fluffy arrives so Venti starts taking actions)
- Sylvia & Venti get Ashro and Flendar up
- Snek joins the fray
- Sylvia dispels hallowed ground
- Nako sends Jaquelo to hell (literally)
- Ashro and Nako pull a circular firing squad and take each other out
	- Ashro is just unconscious, not fully dead
- The platform begins to sink and tilt
- Nako’s body slides into the liquid, then he starts cackling (mf had a second phase)
- A giant fucking blob monster with melting faces crawls out of the liquid and forms into Nako
- A rust colored spiral appears behind blob!Nako and proceeds to yeet him forward through time, killing him
- “Fred” appears and tells the group he’ll teleport them out when they are ready to go
	- (real season finale energy pt 3)
- Ashro spots a magic rod in the now drained liquid pool and grabs it with mage hand
	- Rod of the Pact Keeper
- “Fred” teleports the group back home
- Once back, Karen notifies Ashro that since Nako is dead, Ashro has gotten a promotion to help Karen achieve world domination (whether he wants to help or not)
	- (real season finale energy pt 3)

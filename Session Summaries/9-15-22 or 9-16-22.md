## Full Summary
Note: Due to the heavy amount of roleplay I did in certain main sections of the session, some small portions of the notes are incomplete. If you can think of an important detail I missed, please DM me 
- Group - Trik investigates last room in the dungeon of time(Metal Man Room)
	- Three normal looking walls and one clipped diagonally through the room
	- There’s the top half of a humanoid being, but instead of being made of flesh it’s made of metal
	- One of the hands is a sword blade
	- When touched, it attacks the thing that touched it. If that thing is metal, it quickly rusts and turns to dust
- Trik tries to recover(loot) Tiz’s body
	- Finds 15 flattened gold pieces
- Ashro, Venti, & Sylvia find Jaonos in the red key room
- Jaonos is in a very hysterical/panicked state
	- He doesn’t recognize any of the group
	- Due to this, he shoots Ashro when he enters the room
- Ashro tries to comfort him but it doesn’t work
- The three talk and Ashro goes to ask Trik what Jaonos’s mental state was like when Trik last saw him
	- Jaonos freaked out when the door to the dragon room locked behind Trik
- Back in the red key room, Sylvia gives Jaonos a blanket, which helps calm him down some
	- He hides under it and lays down in a fetal position
- Ashro returns, and the three agree to wait 10-ish minutes to see if Jaonos gets to the point where he can walk to the portal
- After the 10 minutes, Ashro talks to Jaonos again
	- Jaonos’s mental state has improved enough that he can walk to the portal and waits for the rest of the group
- The group - Trik gathers at the portal
- Ashro yells to Trik to grab the gear
- Trik picks up the spike that the gear was floating above
- Trik works his way back
	- As he moves from room to room, the room he is in gets restored when he enters and starts to deteriorate as soon as he leaves
- Trik gets to the portal and the group leaves
- Everyone appears slightly above the teleported copper dragon
	- Everyone but Ashro manages to slide off the dragon somewhat safely
	- Ashro lands groin first onto one of the dragon’s horns(nat 1 lol)
- Frederick greets the group
	- Confirms that grabbing the spike under the gear was the right choice, as turning it basically at all would have either turned the group to dust or to fetuses
- No cash reward, just the dragon
- Venti goes back to base to borrow a wagon to get the dragon back
- The group + the dragon get back to our castle
	- Note: we each have our own rooms at this point
- Jaonos is back into a better headspace, so Ashro & Venti talk to him about what happened
	- When asked what happened, he just replied “Past experiences”
	- He confirms this wasn’t his first dungeon
	- Didn’t want to go further into detail about his past in that moment
- Jaonos then takes his leave to his room
- The rest of the group follows
- ~Sylvia dream sequence time~
- The dream starts with Sylvia waking up in her room to find the castle void of other people
- She searches the castle, then goes to search outside
- When she exits the castle, she sees an Owl man(Toz) actively slitting Venti’s throat with the rest of the group dead at his feet, having suffered the same fate
- She is frozen in fear and shock
- The castle then crumbles and a dark goblin tower rises from the rubble
- At the top of the tower is Nako and Toz
	- Nako stole from GoT and has a throne made of bloody daggers
- A humanoid skull with clothing like Sylvia’s falls at Sylvia’s feet and she flees, crying
- She continues running and eventually reaches the edge of a cliff
	- I think she ran through a swamp as well but I don’t really remember the details
- A figure grabs her and tells her to go to the Playful Waters
- She jolts awake and spends an hour or so crying, before cleaning herself up
	- She has been having dreams like this for a while, and always has the figure telling her to go to the Playful Waters at the end
- That morning, Sylvia asks if anyone in the group would be willing to go with her as she goes to the Playful Waters
	- They all say yes
- The group stops by Nourishedvices so Ashro can pick up a new crowbar then continue to the lake
- The group arrives and notices an island in the center of the lake
- Sylvia tests the waters and finds that once her foot gets about an inch under the water, it lands on a solid surface, so she can just walk across
	- Sylvia, who was already a bit worried about this, is now a bit paranoid
- Others in the group try to see if they can also walk, but don’t have the same effect on them
- The group decides to head to the island, with Sylvia walking, Ashro using cryonis to get across, and the rest swimming
- Once they get a bit out into the lake, a current pushes all but Sylvia back
	- This only adds to Sylvia’s worry
- Sylvia really doesn’t want to go alone, so the group heads back and Sylvia offers to carry someone across
- No one is light enough for her to carry them across without taking off her armor, so she goes alone
- Sylvia gets to the island and hears two male voices
	- One is familiar, one isn’t
- She tries to sneak closer to hear the conversation, but ends up tripping and falling, which reveals her

	- Tiz does not like Toz
- Tiz makes a comment about blood not being a strong enough connection for Toz
- Herm pulls out a knife and hands it to Tiz, asking him for a drop of his blood
	- Tiz obliges and draws some blood
- The blood then forms into a map
	- Sylvia is a bit freaked out by the magic blood map and asks what type of magic it is
	- Herm replies that it is a magic you can’t find in books and is from a being Tiz recently met
- Herm finds Toz on the map and it dissipates
- The map was pointing to Cruelstirs, which makes Sylvia nervous
- ? Tiz is annoyed and asks why Herm needed Sylvia here 
	- He now understands why he was needed, but not why Sylvia was
- Sylvia decides to bite the bullet and takes off her hood and bandana, revealing to Tiz she is a goblin
	- Tiz now has a better understanding of why she was need
- Herm asks if they have any last questions, so Sylvia asks who he is
	- Herm is a cheeky SOB and asks in a mildly threatening way if that is really information Sylvia wants
	- Sylvia takes the hint and doesn’t press

	- The final wisdom: Don’t die, it’s bad for your health
- Sylvia asks Tiz not to share her identity with the others, and while he disagrees with her not sharing her identity, he respects her choice and agrees not to tell
(At some point in the previous conversation or the one with the rest of the group, Tiz’s sister Tuz is brought up but idk when)
- The two start walking back across the water, but are then pushed by a wave and “surf” most of the distance
	- They hit land about 20 feet from the rest of the group
- Ashro looks at them confused, then starts laughing

	- Ashro, Flendar, and Jaonos all say yes

	- She shares with Ashro that she spent time there and “lost friends”
	- Sylvia then goes to her room and cries some more
- Some time later, Tiz knocks on Sylvia’s door 
- Sylvia asks who it is and Tiz pokes his head in
- The two start to talk, but the conversation quickly shifts to one she doesn’t want others to hear, so she closes the door and moves to sit closer to Tiz
(some more stuff missing here)
- Tiz asks if she thinks it’s ok that they are asking the others to go with them when the others don’t know the the full story of why they are going
- Sylvia says she thinks the group should still be able to come along, but she also feels guilty about not telling them the full story
- Sylvia and Tiz get to talking about backstories
	- Sylvia shares that she was taken to Cruelstirs and forced to stay against her will, because disobedient goblins can also be thrown into the birthing pools to be used as fuel
	- She shares that she and Nako used to be good friends, but after he brought her to see the pools, she couldn’t keep denying the horrible acts the goblins were doing and ran away
	- Tiz shares that as a child, he and his sister relied on Toz(their older brother) as they didn’t have parents and were very poor, but then one day Toz left(saying he would return) and then never came back, leaving Tiz and Tuz to fend for themselves when the two could barely care for themselves
- ? As he leaves Tiz says he is going to share some context with the group of why he is tied to the main quest, Sylvia says she’ll think about doing the same(and she will decided that she will do the same)
(end-ish of the second section of missing stuff)

	- Lost in his own thoughts and working himself up
- Tiz asks if he’d like some help
- Jaonos says thanks but no thanks
- Tiz shares some wisdom he was taught
	- Something along the lines of “Work out the thoughts, otherwise the mind disconnects from the body”

- Seeing this, Tiz gets into a fighting stance with his training sword
	- Jaonos grabs a training sword and the two spar casually and chat
- Tiz asks Jaonos if he wants to talk
- Jaonos replies something about taking it out in combat and that melee won’t be its final form(not 100% sure on that last half)
- Tiz lunges for Jaonos’ chest and hits it, knocking him to the ground
	- On the hit, Jaonos’ amulet glows
- Tiz pushes Jaonos a bit by mentioning that Jaonos was attacking the dummies with a lot more ferocity then he is putting into the spar
- Tiz then goes for a downwards cleave, but puts more energy into it then he had been
	- Jaonos wasn’t expecting the increased amount of energy and falls
	- Tiz points the sword at Jaonos
- Jaonos sighs and touches the tip of the sword, causing it to rot in Tiz’s hands
- Jaonos then stands up, passes his training sword(or one of his shortswords) to Tiz, takes out his short sword and agrees to fight for real
- Tiz takes a swing at Jaonos, who doesn’t dodge
	- Instead of being hit, he phases through the sword
	- His amulet is glowing
- A few more swings are traded when Tiz throws his sword like a spear and follows after it for a punch
- Jaonos blocks the sword but gets hit by the uppercut to the jaw
	- Jaonos goes flying up, and transforms into a Nightwalker(the creepy tall black horned monster in vc-text)
		- The nightwalker has a glowing point on his chest where Jaonos’s amulet was

	- This alerts Sylvia and Ashro to come out and see what is happening

	- Sylvia and Ashro have a clear view of it, Tiz can see it but has more pressing matters
- The decaposhpere begins showing scenes
	- The first is the town of Shakenheathers in ruin
		- There is fire and screams can be heard
	- The scene shifts
	- The second shows Jaonos and three golden figures fighting a horde of shadowy figures
		- The three figures are a Dwarf, a Kobolt, and an Elf(kinda sus)
	- The scene progresses and the golden figures get picked off one by one
		- Illusion Jaonos gets more distraught after each figure is killed 
	- Once the last golden figure is killed, illusion Jaonos stops fighting and explodes in light
	- The light fades, leaving an invisible figure outlined in flakes of gold and no Nightwalker Jaonos
	- All but one flake fades out
- Tiz goes to try and guide the flake down to where the invisible figure was without touching it, but the flake doesn’t want to move
- Tiz holds the flake in his hands, and it grows into a glass sphere(The Jompass)
	- Inside the sphere is a golden compass that is pointing south west
	- Orbiting the sphere is a golden ring with “Meet me where I had my last stand” written on it
	- (To see what the Jompass looks like but in silver, check vc-text)
- Tiz, who was hit once by Nightwalker Jaonos and lost more than half of his health, collapses from system shock
- Sylvia rushes over to Tiz and heals him
- Ashro also goes over and examines the Jompass
	- Finds nothing glaringly important magic wise(even with a 24)
- The three go into the castle to use a map to try and pinpoint where the Jompass is pointing
	- The Jompass helpfully updates when near a map to point to the location on that map
- The Jompass is pointing towards Shakenheathers

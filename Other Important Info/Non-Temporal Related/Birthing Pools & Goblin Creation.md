- Goblins are originally made by demons to do their dirty work
- Goblins canâ€™t reproduce so they use birthing pools to make more goblins
- A template is used as a base, then the liquid in the pool makes new goblins that have mutations off of the template
	- Templates are children of other races who were stolen or goblins who were disloyal
	- The more soul a goblin gets, the more sentient they are
- Victims are thrown into the pools and their bodies and souls get dissolved
- The souls get fragmented, and that damage creates a lot of evil energy

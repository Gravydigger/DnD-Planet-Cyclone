- Info from Berdan
- A higher power among the gods has put a “gag order” on any communication to mortals who follow a religion about the Clockwork Infection
	- Due to the order only saying that the information couldn’t be shared with religious mortals specifically, Berdan could to talk to [[Ashro]] and [[Flendar]]
	- The other gods were forced to follow the order
- The higher power is also conducting an “audit” on the situation with the Clockwork Infection
	- After the audit is done, the gag order will in theory also be lifted
- The higher power is respected, at least by Berdan  
- While Berdan didn’t know about the Temporal Gear, a god of time might know more due to the gear being in their sphere of influence

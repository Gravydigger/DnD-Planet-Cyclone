- Nickname: The Clockwork Infection
- A marker for something to come investigate
- Possible Causes
	- Traveling from one universe to another through a Temporal Dungeon
	- Being targeted by the Bellhop
	- Exposure to drifters
- Centered around a small rusty shard of metal
	- Shards are on the right side or upper half of the chest
	- Shards can only be pulled out by the Bellhop(and maybe other temporal magic creatures?)
- Causes black tendrils to spread through the being’s body
	- Tendrils are thick oil with metal shavings in them
	- If a healing/curing magic is used on the being, the tendrils retreat but quickly regrow to the original size
	- Seems to have a maximum size it can grow to(for the moment?)
- Eventually leads to the infected falling into a sick, delirious state
	- Time frame of this happening is unknown, looks to be between a week to 2 and a half months
	- When in this state, infected are in essentially a stasis
		- Don’t need food or water
		- Don’t defecate
		- Treatment for illnesses/disorders had before the infection do not need to be treated
- Not contagious unless one is trying to infect
	- Direct exposure of black ooze to open wound
- Earliest known case (that we know the date of): 2.5 months
- Current known cases:
	- The PPCs(currently in Sweepstrangers)(currently stable)
- Transmutation magic
- Cannot be cured by:
	- Lay on Hands
	- Blessings from priests
- Can be cured by:
	- The Bellhop(not a great survival rate though)
- Black ooze
	- Best way to dispose of is by blessing from priest
	- Can also burn or dilute in water, but aren’t as effective
- Gods’ Responses   
	- When asked for help, either get vague responses or “no”
	- From Shurie’s anonymous source:  “This is a reminder when you mess with time”
- Can (maybe) be masked to protect the infected

- Nicknamed: Bellhop
- Job: Fix problems with temporal stuff, the “first responder”, the “ambassador”
	- Is in favor of the affected universe (other temporal beings likely aren’t)
- A large, six-armed creature with no face
- Temporal magic
- Holds four swords, a bell, and a lantern with a temporal gear in it
	- Swords have the ability to make small bubbles of frozen time
	- Is not affected by this time bubble
- Has some connection to the Temporal Dungeons
	- Does damage control for when things escape?
- Has the ability to cure people of the Clockwork Infection
	- Has some sort of judging process on whether it cures or kill the infected
	- The trait/traits that are judged aren’t obvious
- Doesn’t attack those who don’t actively attack it, get in its way, or have history with it
- Can understand and speak common
- Can move very fast (as fast as a galloping horse)
- Some (or all) are adversarial to Drifters
- When heavily damaged
	- Seems to “freeze” in place, regardless of gravity
	- Looses collision with objects
	- Slowly regenerates
- Uses the most direct route/option to fix things, but will use other methods if most direct isn’t working
- Exactly what it deems as most direct/best for the universe changes from BH to BH
- Can be reasoned with if they want to be reasoned with
- Will go away when it deems the issue no longer exists
- Once it is done, it will erase knowledge of its existence through magic (or murder)
- Tends towards non-violent clean ups, but will take the easiest route
- If it can’t fix things, it will lead to the “restart” aka eradication of the problem universe(s)/timeline(s)
- A handful of infected people might not be see as reason to escalate things, but if BH is being blocked from them, that could result in escalation (yikes)

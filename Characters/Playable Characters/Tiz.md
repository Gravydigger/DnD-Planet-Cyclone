### Backstory
When he was very young, it was just him, his sister & brother
He and his sister relied on his brother for survival as they were very poor
One day, [[Jaquelo]] left on a ship after promising [[Tiz]] he would come back, then never did
He and his sister were barely able to care for themselves
[[Tiz]] (and maybe Shurie) then trained at the Church of Prison
Seems to have been banished or something similar by the Church of Prison
At some point, [[Tiz]] stayed in [[Shakenheathers]] with Prax

>The blockade of Nourishedvises has been a success. I expect the town to rip itself apart within a month, if not sooner. Signs of instability are showing. Furthermore, the authorities are not yet aware of our involvement, and will allow us to gain a strong foothold further east.

>Whilst I understand your concern regarding finding Sylvia. I am aware of your concern about me over-extending, but Sylvia contains knowledge that can be used to undermine our efforts. A whilst she was not particular high ranking, I still believe she could do damage, or destroy future generation! I have located her to this town, and make sure she will no longer be a threat. Also, do inform me of your progress hunting the others from her group. They could be useful in luring her into a trap.
